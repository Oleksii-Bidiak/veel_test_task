cd veel_test_task
```

### Install dependencies:

## üìå Features
- API queries: Uses jsonplaceholder.typicode.com as a fake API to demonstrate CRUD operations.
- Limitations: jsonplaceholder does not save changes. To reflect the deletion or creation of elements, the React Query cache is updated locally (queryClient.setQueryData).
- Caching: Thanks to React Query, data is cached and updated without re-requests to the server.

## Technologies used
- Next.js
- Tailwindcss
- Tanstack Query
